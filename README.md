**Various machine learning techniques to get the best result for scouring produced in river due to different features**


**Scouring:**

[scouring(1).ipynb](/scouring(1).ipynb):


In this, we have used test and train data to calculate the scouring produced by a river flow by using several optimisation like randomsearch, grid searchcv and bayesian optimisation to get the best output with visualisation using bar graphs and heat maps.



[scouring(2).ipynb](/scouring(2).ipynb):


In this, there is a  combination between different prunners and samplers in **OPTUNA** to get the best combination for different machine learning models and gave engaging visualisation for different models. This also includes the use of lime, which plots the importance for each scour value produced in output corresponding to given features.
