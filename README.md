**Various machine learning techniques to get the best result**
[scouring(1).ipynb](/scouring(1).ipynb): In this, we have used test and train data to calculate the scouring produced by a river flow by using several optimisation like randomsearch, grid searchcv and bayesian optimisation 
                                         to get the best output with visualisation
